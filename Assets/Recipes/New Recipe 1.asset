  completedText: 'If sores start popping up all over your skin, the solution is very
    simple: just peel the entire thing off! My special medicinal blend of <b>potent
    bleach</b> and <b>Bellavendetta leaf extract</b> was all but guaranteed to cause
    it to slide right off. I gave this solution to Wanda in the hopes that it would
    end her nightly massage woes.

    

    I may have given her a little bit
    of a fright by showing off the monster her man was deep inside (literally), but
    it will thankfully be the last intolerable sight she will ever witness in this
    lifetime.

    

    Then again, Wanda does love her horror movies. Perhaps
    one of these days I can take her on a ladies night out to the theatre to watch
    The Blob! I''d love to make jokes about how the monster is better looking than
    her husband ever was.'
