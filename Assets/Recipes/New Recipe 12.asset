  completedText: "With a handful of shredded <b>Bellanova leaves</b> soaked in profuse
    amounts of <b>single malt Scotch</b>, I gave Wanda a homemade cigar with enough
    raw firepower to punch a hole the size of JFK\u2019s head through anyone\u2019s
    airways. \r\n\r\nHow unfortunate that poor Mr. Ellis got one drag in before his
    throat was set aflame and he started coughing his guts out, but it\u2019s not
    like it wasn't bound to happen anyway, what with the sorry state of his lungs.
    It was either that or lung cancer, and the paramedics agreed this was probably
    the more merciful way to go.\r\n\r\nWith Mr. Ellis gone, it won't be long before
    the smoke clears on Wanda\u2019s mood. Maybe I\u2019ll pay her a visit someday,
    and help her start that garden she\u2019d always been dreaming of growing. I
    think I can give her a couple of tips to get started."
