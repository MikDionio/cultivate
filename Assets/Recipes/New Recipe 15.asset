  completedText: 'I gave Mary Anne a suitably deadly replacement for her special
    car cleaning products using the <b>Bellavendetta berry</b> and <b>some vintage
    perfume</b> I got as a gift.

    

    That very night, her husband got into
    a terrible, fatal accident on the speedway, as one would if you lose consciousness
    while you''re on the wheel. How reckless!

    

    Nevertheless, congratulations
    to the new widow. I''m sure I''ll be seeing more of Mary Anne''s cheery personality
    once again.'
