  completedText: 'When I sent Barbara my gift, she almost wigged out at the sight
    of the inhaler. A medicinal product was definitely the opposite of what she requested
    from me. After explaining that the combination of sweet and pure <b>countryside
    honey</b> and the Bellavendetta''s <b>waxy green leaves</b> was not made for
    life-saving, she felt nothing but excitement.

    

    For the plan to work,
    Barbara conveniently "lost" her husband''s Rolex, dealing a stressful conconction
    of asthma and panic. In the throes of hysteria, he reached for his inhaler. Minutes
    later, he was convulsing and grasping for air in their saloon. He was the first
    man to die from a missing luxury watch.

    

    Cheers to another lady''s
    well-deserved freedom from another selfish and self-absorbed man. We should find
    some time to celebrate with caviar and champagne.'
