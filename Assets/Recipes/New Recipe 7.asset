  completedText: 'Barbara wanted to make breakfast especially festive, seeing as
    this was going to be the last one she''s ever going to share with her horrendous
    husband. The flapjacks were the same, but what made this batch special was the
    garnish: a ritzy recreation of fruits, thanks to <b>gelatin powder, the wicked
    berries</b> fresh from the my garden, and a little bit of cookery and chemistry.

    

    Immediately
    after scarfing breakfast down, the pig started choking on his own food. Sadly,
    the Heimlich could not save him from his throat closing completely. He turned
    into a cautionary tale for greedy gourmands, lest they want to kick the bucket
    by slumping over into a plate of poisoned pancakes.

    

    Barbara no longer
    has to play personal butler to an upperclass brute, all while relishing the sudden
    influx of money and property into her name. We should find some time to celebrate
    with caviar and champagne.'
