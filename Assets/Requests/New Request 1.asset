  text: '"I gave Mary Anne a suitably deadly replacement for her special car cleaning
    products using the <b>Bellavendetta berry</b> and <b>some vintage perfume</b>
    I got as a gift.


    That very night, her husband got into a terrible, fatal
    accident on the speedway, as one would if you lose consciousness while you''re
    on the wheel. How reckless!


    Nevertheless, congratulations to the new widow.
    I''m sure I''ll be seeing more of Mary Anne''s cheery personality once again."'
  defaultText: 'Mary Anne''s husband of 20 years seems completely disinterested in
    her as a person, but he''s been driving her crazy ever since he hit his midlife
    crisis. In fact, he spends more time with his ''64 Mustang than her! He''s even
    asked her to buy specific special products for the car, <b>as he loves the smell
    of berries</b>.


    Mary Anne plans to use this to her advantage, thinking
    she can sabotage his car for a one-way ticket on the highway to hell.


    Perhaps
    I can make use of the Bellavendetta plant in my garden to help her out. Though,
    I think I will need <b>something more fragrant</b> to help hide any whiff of
    the noxious substance, and Mary Anne''s malice.'
