  text: '"Mary Anne''s husband of 20 years seems completely disinterested in her
    as a person, but he''s been driving her crazy ever since he hit his midlife crisis.
    In fact, he spends more time with his ''64 Mustang than her! He''s even asked
    her to buy specific special products for the car, <b>as he loves the smell of
    berries</b>.  Mary Anne plans to use this to her advantage, thinking she can
    sabotage his car the next time she cleans it.  Perhaps I can make use of the
    Bellavendetta plant in my garden to help her out. Though, I think I will need
    <b>something more fragrant</b> to help hide any whiff of the noxious substance,
    and Mary Anne''s malice."'

    car cleaning products using the <b>Bellavendetta berry</b> and <b>some vintage
    perfume</b> I got as a gift.  That very night, her husband got into a terrible,
    fatal accident on the speedway, as one would if you lose consciousness while
    you''re on the wheel. How reckless!  Nevertheless, congratulations to the new
    widow. I''m sure I''ll be seeing more of Mary Anne''s cheery personality once
    again."'
