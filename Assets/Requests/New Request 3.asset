  text: "Woe be to the woman wed to the washed-up chauvinist. Wanda lives with her
    serial smoker and waste of a husband, and it\u2019s because of him that their
    house constantly stinks to high heavens of smoldering tobacco. It\u2019s very
    clear the old wheezer doesn\u2019t have much life left in him, so she\u2019s
    taking the opportunity to steal his last breath.\r\n\r\nDecades of smoking have
    dulled her husband\u2019s senses to the point that only something with <b>an
    absolutely infernal kick</b> can register on his blackened taste buds, and he
    is just one bad cigar drag away from inducing <b>a bout of pneumonitis</b> in
    his smoke-choked lungs.\r\n\r\nEven without the excessive smoking, his body betrays
    him with the ails and afflictions of old age. Wanda has to soothe these with
    some <b>clear medicinal salve</b> every night, and if she has to reach into one
    more unspeakable place she might just throw up. Maybe I can work my magic and
    give her some well-needed breathing room\u2026 I'm sure no one will look twice
    at a no-good pensioner with <b>obscenely raw rashes</b> all over his body."
